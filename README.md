## Semi-Supervised Learning for Geological Image Classification
### Official repository for the paper "No labels, no Problem: Exploring Semi-Supervised Learning for Geological Image Classification"

#### Abstract
Labelled datasets within Geoscience can often be small whilst deep learning algorithms require large datasets to learn a robust relationship between the data and its label and avoid overfitting.  To overcome the paucity of data, transfer learning has been employed in classification tasks. But an alternative exists: there often is a large corpus of unlabeled data which may enhance the learning process.  To evaluate this potential for subsurface data, we compare a high-performance semi-supervised learning algorithm (SimCLRv2) with supervised transfer learning on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in geological image classification. 

#### Introduction

This package uses the SimCLRv2 to classify images in a semi-supervised manner.  
The code offers the following functionality:
* x
* y
* z
